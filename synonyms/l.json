      "Liberalism was the political ideology that sparked the American Revolution. … The government's role within this liberal ideology was to protect individual rights. As economic power became more concentrated in the late 1800s, that liberal ideology evolved so that Americans saw the government's role not as limited to protecting their rights, but also as protecting their economic well-being. This latter role is the ideology of progressivism.",
      "Until recently, left-wing ideology had been dominated by traditional liberalism, which advocates for equality through persuasion and consensus-building across voting blocs. More recently, progressivism has challenged this view, emphasizing political activism within, for example, racial and cultural identities.",
      "\"But I think, in my view and my understanding, progressivism starts with this idea that government exists to help achieve a national purpose and enable our own individual self-expression and self-realization. … liberalism thinks that freedom is freedom from foreign rule, freedom to participate in government. Progressivism thinks that freedom fundamentally is freedom of self-expression and self-autonomy.\"",
      "In the U.S. liberalism means the embrace of an activist, interventionist government expanding its involvement and responsibilities in the economy and centralizing decision making. … During World War I some of the leading progressive writers began to use the word liberalism as a substitute for progressivism, which had become tarnished by its association with their fallen hero, Theodore Roosevelt, who had run and lost on a Progressive third-party ticket.",
      "The social and intellectual upheaval of the late nineteenth century eventually led to a rupture in Protestantism. Some drifted toward theological liberalism, rejecting historically orthodox beliefs about Jesus's birth, humanity's need for salvation, and other supernatural parts of the Bible; others retrenched and formed the fundamentalist movement.",
      "Economic liberalism is based on the principles of personal liberty, private property, and limited government interference. The term liberalism should be understood in its historical context. Classical liberalism emphasized liberty from government regulation. In the economic context this would include the elimination of restriction on the choice of occupations or transfers of land.",
      "Through the commerce clause, courts began giving Congress new powers, opening the way to the programs and policies of mid-century liberalism.",
      "The second root of modern democracy is liberalism, defined as that set of social and political beliefs, attitudes, and values which assumes the universal and equal application of the law and the existence of basic human rights superior to those of state or community.",
      "Certainly, part of the reason certain newspapers (like this one, founded in 1881) have committed to objectivity is because of a strong, moral commitment to the free exchange of ideas—liberalism, in its classic sense.",
      "Raised by parents who prided themselves on their liberalism and charity, she was encouraged to romp with her brothers, to succeed in her schooling and to absorb her father's patriotic war stories.",
      "Classical liberalism regards justice and liberty as requiring a much more limited role for government than do modern forms of liberalism. Indeed, apart from the provision of a limited range of goods that benefit all but that, most argue, society seems unable to secure save by governmental provision (so-called public goods, such as roads and harbors and, more controversially, relief of destitution), the only role for government that classical liberalism considers consistent with human liberty and justice is that of restraining individuals from constraining others, plus protecting individuals in the possession of whatever lawful property is theirs. Depending on the context, libertarianism can be seen as either the contemporary name for classical liberalism, adopted to avoid confusion in those countries where liberalism is widely understood to denote advocacy of expansive government powers, or as a more radical version of classical liberalism.",
      "… believed in eliminating economic privileges while protecting private property rights, ending state monopolies and regulations, and freeing trade. They were classical liberals not to be confused with the modern definition of the word liberal, with its connotations of economic regulation.",
      "Classical liberals wanted both individual liberty and (some degree of) government intervention. This ambiguity persists in our own time. … Today's libertarians can be seen as classical liberals who want less government intervention and more individual liberty. The argument for a total break between classical liberals and libertarians does not quite work.",
      "Tolerance rightly understood serves an important public purpose. In the classical liberal understanding, it means according respect to the beliefs and practices of others, and learning to live peacefully and civilly with one another despite deep differences.",
      "… a more consistently classical-liberal party—pro-business, pro-choice …",
      "A veneration for private property as the site where the rights of dominance and control are realized has long been central to the individualist orientation of classical liberalism …",
      "At the editorial page, this has meant that for a century we have been able to adhere to a worldview we now distill to the phrase \"free people and free markets.\" This began, more or less, with the classical liberalism of William Hamilton, who as a Scotsman before emigrating had dabbled in British Liberal Party politics.",
      "a candidate who describes herself as a social liberal and fiscal conservative",
      "… he showed a consistent tendency toward social liberalism, as when he criticised the US Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade, and he oversaw a continued rise in legal immigration.",
      "Much of mainstream Anglo-American philosophy of the time [in the 1960s] was abstruse and insular. But [John] Rawls produced a book intended to lay out fair rules for a just society. It was breathtakingly ambitious, says [Catherine] Audard: He asked: 'what was a reasonable view of justice that a wide consensus could agree on'. … He linked the idea that you would fight for the rule of law for democratic institutions to a simultaneous battle against poverty and inequality. So on the one hand you have political liberalism—defence of the rule of law, formal rights and so on. And on the other hand you had social liberalism, which was concerned with questions of equality, inclusion and social justice.",
      "Although Sweden is often seen internationally as a paragon of social liberalism, many of Imam's songs have highlighted the racism, misogyny and homophobia she believes permeate society here.",
      "The myth of Dutch tolerance may have faded in recent years, but the country still cherishes its social liberalism. Prostitution is legal, soft drugs are available to locals and foreign tourists alike, and the Netherlands prides itself on blazing the trail for gay marriage.",
      "These romantic medievalists may moreover have strengthened Tolstoy's natural anti-intellectualism and anti-liberalism …",
